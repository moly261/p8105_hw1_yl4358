```{r problem1}
library(tidyverse)
first_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(8),
  vec_log = sample > 0,
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is", "YI", "LIU", "and", "study", "biostatistics"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("high", "medium", "low", "high", "medium", "low", "low", "low"))
)

```
The mean of the sample is `r mean(pull(first_df, sample))`

The mean of vec_log is `r mean(pull(first_df, vec_log))`

We cannot take the mean of character vector and factor vector.
